Automated Tasks: Utilized cron jobs to automate various tasks, enhancing operational efficiency, reducing manual workload, and saving computed data to MongoDB.
Backend Process Management: Utilized PM2 to manage backend processes, including monitoring applications and scheduling automatic server restarts to improve memory management and ensure application stability.
Nginx Implementation: Implemented and configured Nginx on both development and production servers to optimize web application performance, enhance security, and manage traffic efficiently and conducted routine maintenance and updates to ensure server reliability and uptime.
Code Quality and Management: Conducted code reviews and managed code repositories using GitHub and Git, ensuring code quality and facilitating collaboration within the development team.
Database Performance Optimization: Enhanced database performance by transitioning from the MongoDB native driver to Mongoose, optimizing queries for efficiency, and utilizing aggregation pipelines for complex operations.
